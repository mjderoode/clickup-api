# Clickup API Laravel Package 

This Laravel package simplifies the process of connecting to, manipulating, and requesting data from ClickUp, a powerful project management tool. Designed for developers, it provides an easy-to-use interface for integrating ClickUpâ€™s functionalities into Laravel applications. With this package, you can effortlessly manage tasks, projects, and other resources within ClickUp, streamlining your workflow and enhancing productivity.

## Installation

Add the following to your composer.json:
```
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "vcs",
        "url": "https://github.com/mjderoode/clickup-api"
    }
],
```

Install mjderoode/clickup-api with composer:
```bash
composer require mjderoode/clickup-api
```

Add your clickup key token to the .env:
```env
CLICKUP_API_KEY="pk_########_################################"
```

**OPTIONAL:** To publish the config file, use the following command (the file is published as `config/clickup-api.php`): 
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=clickup-api-config
```
## Usage/ Examples

Each endpoint uses its own Service, most of the methods return Collections (`Illuminate\Support\Collection`). For example, if you want to get a specific task, you can achieve this by using the `TaskService`: 

```php
use Mjderoode\ClickupApi\Services\TaskService; 

$task_service = new TaskService();

$task = $task_service->getTask();
```

The same goes for the `ListService`. If you want to copy a task from one list to another, do the following: 
```php
use Mjderoode\ClickupApi\Services\ListService; 

$list_service = new ListService();

$list_service->addTaskToList(list_id: 901505402536, task_id: "86bznf44d");
```

Check out both Services for all available methods. Extended documentation will be coming soon.
